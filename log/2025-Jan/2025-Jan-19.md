Finally manag3d to get a SM200 4554 squeezer die for brazier head AN455 rivets. Squeezed new rivets around the outer edge of the firewall to attach angles.

Match drilled and installed the 2 tunnel angles on bottom edges of firewall. Used AN455 rivet for all rivets, although the manual calls for flush rivets for the center two on the top angle that is not necessary for the 363i-FP engine which uses a firewall heater assembly from the EX3.
