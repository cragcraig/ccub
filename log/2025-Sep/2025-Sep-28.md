Clamped left then right boot cowl side panels in place against firewall tabs and tunnel edges, working from the bottom up and ensuring the firewall stayed flat (up against the MDF stiffener aid) and that the front edge of the side panels are flush with the front edge of each firewall tab.

Required significant clamping:

* 65-ish small (1") spring clamps on all firewall tabs and tunnel edges
* The back of the boot cowls sides against the sides of the fuselage using pieces of wood held with 3" spring clamps
* Two long clamps to pull the tops of the side panels forward and flush with the 1/2" MDF firewall stiffener aid, ensuring the firewall is flat
