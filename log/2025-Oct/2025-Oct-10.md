Adjusted left boot cowl side and spacer to slightly improve the alignment that had shifted slightly while first placing the boot cowl spacers under the spring clamps. Slightly filed top edge of each wide spacer so they could both be pushed fully in against the firewall without conflicting with each other.

Match drilled #30 from boot cowl sides through firewall tabs and boot cowl spacers, deburred, dimpled, and placed clekos.

Started on the left side at the seventh tab from the bottom and worked to the top, then down to the bottom. Repeated on the right side.
